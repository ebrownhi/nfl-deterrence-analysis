# BigDataBowl2025

I haven't started yet mb. 

I think the first things could be writing a piece of code that can read the csv and partition it into only the important parts (probably trivial in R), 
then create something that can visualize plays or at least pre-snap motion, so we can use diagrams of plays in the write-up.
